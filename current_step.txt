* njit is simply a decorator to make loops run more quickly
* a spline is a piecewise polynomial. Spline interpolation/approximation tries
	to model a set of data by splitting it into regimes, each of which is approximated
	by a different spline.



small victories: {
    the full installation, all the way to RIMEz, works
    if I use pip instead of conda.
}
