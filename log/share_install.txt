Apparently, mixing conda and pip will really kill you, so try to avoid that for
as long as you can.

What worked and what did not? Back to basics

The following lines will totally annihilate an environment:
	conda remove --name hera --all
	conda env remove --name hera

Setting up the environment:

I had to do
	conda create --name hera python=3.7.6 --channel conda-forge
and NOT
	conda create --name hera
because the second line, for some reason, created a python 2.7 environment. What!

Configuring package environment:

I had to also do
	conda config --add channels conda-forge
Because, for some reason, that second flag on the line from earlier did not
truly add the desired source-forge channel. Anyway, bypassing that line
would immediately fail this next part:

Installation of pyuvdata (NOT tested in the long-term):
	conda install numpy scipy astropy h5py python-casacore astropy-healpix pyyaml
		Windows failed python-casacore

Installation of hera_sim (NOT tested in the long-term):
	conda install -c conda-forge pyuvdata aipy attrs healpy
		Windows failed all but attrs
			* Healpy on the conda-forge channel is intended as a pre-compiled version for Unix-like systems

Installation of RIMEz:
	conda install -c anaconda gfortran_osx-64 
		probably not necssary on Windows machines?
	conda install -c conda-forge fftw 
	conda install numba cffi


Pipe dream:
	conda install matplotlib ipython jupyter codecov
