# HERA: personal notes and demonstrations regarding the calculation and simulation of sky visibilities

Essentially, all theory that drives the code in this repository hails from Nunhokee et al, 2018. The paper is so important that the repository contains a copy under `resources/`.

For properties of point sources, I use the GLEAMEGCAT. To jump straight to a search, use [this link.](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/db-perl/W3Browse/w3table.pl?tablehead=name%3Dgleamegcat&Action=More+Options) For information about the nature of the catalog, see [this page.](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/radio-catalog/gleamegcat.html)

Unfortunately, the frequency with which the file hierarchy of this repository is reorganized precludes the description here of the various directories and their purposes. While it is tedious to open and shut down individual notebooks, my hope is that they are at least sufficiently self-explanatory to provide a good deal of the documentation that I would have recorded here.
