This is currently just a placeholder script.

What do I want it to do?

I want to run it once, based on whatever GLEAM catalog files I happen
to have in the repository at the time of running.

It will generate a numpy array of GLEAM objects,
than I will use numpy savez to get the array into a disk file.
