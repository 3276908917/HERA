# Package/code maintenance, rather than theory / specific simulation tasks


1. Test gal_to_topo to make sure it still works

2. Test ha_to_topo to verify the docstring has the correct ordering of
	returned altitude and azimuth.

3. add a __repr__ function for the GLEAM object.

4. update every notebook in the repository
	* import skyflux as sf, etc etc
	* delete all de-bugging cells, condense comments

5. absorb more notebooks into the skyflux.demo module
	Furthermore, split the skyflux.demo module into several child modules,
	each of which is intended to illustrate and elaborate upon the functionality
	of one of the non-demo scripts.
