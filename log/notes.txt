Notes:

YAML is even looser than XML. It is as if a CSV file had syntax requirements.

UV coordinates:

    "UV mapping is the 3D modelling process of projecting a 2D image to a 3D model's surface for texture mapping. The letters 'U' and "V' denote the axes of the 2D texture because 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'"

    So, I gather that this as how we get a square projectino of HERA's FoV on the celestial sphere.

pyuvdata:

    This page has a good example of reading in beam files (.txt)

My first goal is to run the visibility Jupyter notebook in the hera_sim repo:

    * After installing all of the explicit dependencies, my runs fail
    * I figure out I need to also install uvtools, available at another HERA repo
    * I then figure out that 'pyradiosky' is not importable, so I try
        installing that from RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup
    * That did the trick. I now get the same warnings that the 
        example compiled .ipynb gets.
