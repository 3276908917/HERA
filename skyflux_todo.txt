# Package/code maintenance, rather than theory / specific simulation tasks


0.9 eliminate redundant columns from the GLEAMEGCAT file:
	we are using just three columns:
	1. name
	2. flux at 151 MHz
	3. spectral index

1. Test gal_to_topo to make sure it still works

2. Test ha_to_topo to verify the docstring has the correct ordering of
	returned altitude and azimuth.

3. add a __repr__ function for the GLEAM object.

4. update every notebook in the repository
	* import skyflux as sf, etc etc
	* delete all de-bugging cells, condense comments

5. absorb more notebooks into the skyflux.demo module
	Furthermore, split the skyflux.demo module into several child modules,
	each of which is intended to illustrate and elaborate upon the functionality
	of one of the non-demo scripts.
	
	However, we have to address a building problem that I have
	already suffered: I have so many demos now that I sometimes
	accidentally rewrite demos.
	    An easy fix is to split up the demos script into a folder
	    of demos scripts, where each script demo.s some primary
	    script.
	    
	    However, this system could be difficult to navigate
	    as I frequently write demos that rely heavily on
	    multiple primary scripts.
