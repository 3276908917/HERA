UV coordinates:

    "UV mapping is the 3D modelling process of projecting a 2D image to a 3D model's surface for texture mapping. The letters 'U' and "V' denote the axes of the 2D texture because 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'"

    So, I gather that this as how we get a square projectino of HERA's FoV on the celestial sphere.
