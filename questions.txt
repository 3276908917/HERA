* How do I procure baselines for the simulation?
	(to ask this question truly well,
	I must carefully consider both the definition of a baseline in
	general, and the parameters that I want to use in particular)

	* I am fairly certain that I want a baseline vector.
	At the very least, b_x and b_y

	* A baseline has a delay spectrum

* What are Fourier k modes? Parallel and perpendicular to what?
	* First: what is k space? To what are we Fourier transforming?
	(Still, however: what is a mode?)
		https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/212142/what-is-a-mode

	"The Fourier transformation of V(\vec{\kappa}) to \tilde{V}(\vec{\tau})"
	kappa is not k, though. Keep looking?

Did you ever hear back about the GPU simulation attempt?
	* There seems to be one file in the repository:
		median_filter.py

Beams available from here?
	https://github.com/HERA-Team/HERA-Beams
	or https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera-cst

Why is there a pyuvdata module from RadioAstronomySoftwareGroup
	as well as uvtools from the HERA GitHub?

Not interested in externalizing

    Vivaldi?

Important, to myself
    * HealPIX: we are using a pixel-based coordinate map
