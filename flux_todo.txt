1. finish rotations docstrings

2. finish parser docstrings and rename the file

3. repair the flux package so that we return to the level of functionality
	which we had before we started along the J_script branch

4. update at least three notebooks so that they correctly interact with this
	newer edition of the package.
	4a. the histogram notebook
	4b. ?
	4c. ?

5. Actually work on 2 things that Ridhima suggested in one of the previous calls.

6. Test gal_to_topo to make sure it still works
Test ha_to_topo to verify the docstring has the correct ordering of
	returned altitude and azimuth.
