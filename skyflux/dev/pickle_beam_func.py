This is currently just a placeholder script.

What do I want it to do?

I want to run it once, based on whatever spin 1 harmonics I happen to have
in the repository at the time of running.

Then I want to store this function in a pickle.
When I import skyflux, it should unpickle the function,
    rather than simply recalculating it.
