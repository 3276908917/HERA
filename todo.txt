Implement J_matrix

same frequency, intensity increasing and decreasing for a single source over time

0. J matrix all-ones test
1. plot an A matrix (which one?)
2. plot the cold patch data
3. investigate the J matrix zero debacle?
4. verify that ALL of the functions in rot return (az, alt) and not (alt, az)
5. update every notebook in the repository

S ~/prop\nu^alpha
S_{200} = S_{150} * (200/150)^\alpha

simple test for the computation:
at zenith (ra = LST), a source should be real
(phase is zero)

PING RIDHIMA TO GET FREQUENCY BEAM
    once you have your current pipeline working for this
        frequency

for now, assume that 100-200 MHz is the same frequency
    use spectral index to scale the result
    split it at 1 MHz for now.
    (i.e. same Jones matrix 100-200 MHz for now).
use constant flux independent of frequency
	(this is the same as saying that alpha is equal to one)
	then varying frequency from 100-200 MHz
	'assume it is the same beam between 100 and 200 MHz'
beam variation is what we will eventually be handling anyway
"I will leave the chunking of frequency and time up to you."

create 1D plot from cold patch
    great Slack question: what is the best way
    to visually represent the results?

time axis (2D), frequency axis (3D)

feel free to use orthview to get the
Mueller matrix plots. Figure 1 in (Nunhokee et al)
did not actually use healpy, so feel free to
tinker.
    "Return projected map -> store in variable
    variable -> imshow"

read up on healpy.cartview,
    that is a third option besides Mollview and orthview

do not worry if the axes are not in RA and Dec,
    just get the healpy grid on the A matrices
    like in the Stack Overflow

15 m or 30 m baseline East-West
    I do not remember what this means.

I need to plot the A matrix, to see the leakage terms.
Plot it in healpix. It doesn't have to look like in Ridhima's
paper because she did not use healpix.

(Ask for Ridhima's power spectrum notebook plot for a
single baseline, once the above work has been completed and tested.)
