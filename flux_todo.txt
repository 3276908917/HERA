I:
	vary power law formula to get frequency
	baseline will change in terms of frequency
	A will change in terms of frequency
		For A, we need the different frequency beam files

For bragging about brilliance:
	ON YOUR OWN, you want to find the equation which rotates the J and/or matrices according to time
	ON YOUR OWN, you want to find the equation which predicts the HERA beam patterns,
		i.e. find an equation which makes-obsolete the many files of the form
			HERA_4.9m_E-pattern_151MHz.txt
	
FOR NOW, use simple linear interpolation between the results for a frequency between the
	predecessor and successor frequency nodes (CST text files).




$1. finish rotations docstrings

$2. finish parser docstrings and rename the file

$3. repair the flux package so that we return to the level of functionality
	which we had before we started along the J_script branch

$4. update at least three notebooks so that they correctly interact with this
	newer edition of the package.
	4a. the histogram notebook
	4b. ?
	4c. ?

5. Actually work on 2 things that Ridhima suggested in one of the previous calls.

6. Test gal_to_topo to make sure it still works
Test ha_to_topo to verify the docstring has the correct ordering of
	returned altitude and azimuth.
$Test eq_to_topo similarly

7. add a __repr__ function for the GLEAM object.
