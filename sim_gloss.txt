    * In the shell, to compartmentalize these kinds of
        subjects, I will prefix baseline variables with bl
        and source subset variables with ss

Baselines indicated by lower case letter
a: (136, 143) ~ 102 m

Sources subsets indicated by upper case letter
tuples give sf.catalog.srcs indices    
    A: (3831, 3841, 3851, 3861, 3871)
