* PUT XUBUNTU IN A VIRTUAL BOX ON OTTO


* Read through the UV data python library,
    documenting thoughts and questions as you go
* Look through the simulations,
    documenting your thoughts as you go

* See how to simulate the visibility thing with the equation that Ridhima gave you

(how am I supposed to use the beam file)

---------------

* Read Aaron Parsons delay time paper,
    formulating questions as you go
    * This objective may best be served by using Mac,
        a platform better suited to saving PDF file highlights.

* So, I do not really understand what my goal is. It would be best
    if I laid these things out.

vague ideas and buzz words:

"start off by taking .5 MHz bandwidth"

30-250 MHz range
    * use whatever frequency resolution you want
    * start with a source at the center
    * start with 52 antenna configurations
        (that seems like a lot of work for an initial configuration...)

A is a function of tau and nu, I is a function of nu
    * UV coordinates are frequency- and time-independent
    * 2 pi i (b * s / tau)
        b: baseline length
        s: source position
        tau: delay
    "it is a manner of representing phase"

V_{ij} = AI\exp[2 \pi i (ul + vm)]
    A is the beam model (what?)
    I is the intensity of the point source
    To what A does a given I correspond?

i is a combination of xx and yy
    Q = xx - yy: linear polarization
    V: circular polarization indicates instrumental problems

-----------

* I need to get the data for a single point source and see if it has all
    of the fields that I need in order to write the program.

"The 4Ã—4 matrix A can be seen as a mixing matrix between intrinsic and observed (primed) Stokes parameters"
    * How can I obtain the mixing matrix from the beam file?
