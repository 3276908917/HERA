Original tasks:

1. Just the visibilities, with frequency as axis
2. Hadamard product of visibilities
3. Multiply by the cosmological constant
4. Multiplied by the normalization

We should also do a plot immediately after Fourier-transform, no?

What do we have:

I. LST plot for visibility simulation generation
II. Freq plot for visibility file loader

Issues:

A. Q parameter seems to jump between generation
    and loading of simulation. Or potentially
    we are merely seeing the bigger picture
    with the loader plot because that runs
    along freq whereas the generator plot runs along LST.
    
    In either case, the Q parameter seems to be
    unreasonably high in the readout plot...
    
B. Somehow the U parameter achieves dominance by the end
    of the pipeline. When does this transpire?
    
C. We are using a region
    (3 to 5 hours in intervals of 4 minutes)
    of the cold patch, even though we are nominally
    observing the full sky during that period.
    Should I still use the full range of phi and theta
    over a sphere, even if the time window is thin?
