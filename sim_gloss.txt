simulation glossary
    * In the shell, to compartmentalize these kinds of
        subjects, I will prefix baseline variables with bl
        and source subset variables with ss

Baselines indicated by lower case letter
a: (136, 143) ~ 102.3 m
b: (139, 143) ~ 58.4 m
c: (142, 143) ~ 14.6 m

Sources subsets indicated by upper case letter
lists give sf.catalog.srcs indices    
    A: [3831, 3841, 3851, 3861, 3871]
    B: [0, 968, 1936, 2903, 3871]
        * keep in mind that none of these sources necessarily
        rises/sets in the particular cold patch that I have chosen
        
The lower-case letter that appears at the end
tells you the type of simulation
    h: helix
    w: wedge
